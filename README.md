Rock is a web application boilerplate, based on the [Meteor JavaScript platform](https://www.meteor.com/).
It is intended to be a starting point for developers looking to build their first software product.
The goal above all else is to simplify the process of building your first piece of software.

## Getting Started

```

You're ready to start up the server.
